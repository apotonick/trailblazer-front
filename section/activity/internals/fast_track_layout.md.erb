<%= h3 "FastTrack layout" %>

Based on the `Railway` strategy, the `FastTrack` pattern allows to "short-circuit" steps and exit the circuit at particular events.

This layout provides up to four outputs for any step.

<%= h4 "Operation" %>

It's important to understand that an `Operation` is really just a thin public API around `Activity::FastTrack`. All it adds is a more convenient `#call` method for public use, and the `Result` object. The DSL and features are identical.

Please refer to the [operation docs](#activity-wiring-api-fast-track) to learn how to leverage the fast-track tracks.

<%= h4 "Notes" %>

* All options (`:pass_fast`, `:fail_fast` and `:fast_track`) may be used with `step`, `pass` or `fail`. If in doubt, [render the circuit].
* `:pass_fast` and `:fail_fast` can be used in combination.
