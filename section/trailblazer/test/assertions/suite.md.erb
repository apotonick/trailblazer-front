<%= h3 "Suite" %>

In addition to the above assertion helpers, the "Suite" test mode helps you with configuring defaults, so there's even less code.

The "Suite" test is designed to

* simplify the merging of the input arguments
* merge expected attributes automatically without having to repeat those
* set defaults like the tested operation


A typical operation test case might look as follows.

<%= code "test", zoom: "zoom" %>

<%= h4 "Installation" %>

If you want to use the Suite logic to save typing, instruct our `Test.module` using the `:suite` option (you could've guessed that!).

<%= code "install" %>

This will initialize merging logic along with `default_ctx`, `expected_attributes`, `operation` and `key_in_params`. However, you still need to configure those defaults yourself.

<%= h4 "default_ctx" %>

You can define a `default_ctx` using `let()` (and maintain different versions in `describe` blocks). `default_ctx` defines what to pass *into* the operation per default.

<%= code "default-ctx" %>

Note that `default_ctx` is always the full, complete context you'd normally pass into `Operation.call()`.
