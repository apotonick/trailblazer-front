<%= h3 "Id()" %>

An output can be connected to a particular task by using `Id()`.

<%= code "pay-id" %>

This connects the `failure` output to the previous task, which might create an infinity loop and waste your computing time - it is solely here for demonstrational purposes.

<%#= img "wire-output-id.webp" %>

<%= h3 "Track()" %>

The `Track()` function will snap the output to the next task that is "magnetic to" the track's semantic.

<%= code "pay-track" %>

Since `notify` sits on the "failure" track and hence is "magnetic to" `:failure`, `find_provider` will be connected to it.

<%#= img "wire-track.webp" %>

Using `Track()` with a new track semantic only makes sense when using the [`:magnetic_to` option] on other tasks.

<%= info do %>
Use [Path()] if you want to avoid `Track()` and `:magnetic_to` - this helper does nothing but providing those values to your convenience.
